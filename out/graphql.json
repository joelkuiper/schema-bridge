Pregnant women were recruited when they attended the Bradford Royal Infirmary for their routine maternity care. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about different aspects of their lives including demographics information, physical and mental health and socio-economic information.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2011, 12,453 pregnant women were recruited and 3,353 of their partners. Participants also gave permission for routine data linkage for themselves and their children. The BiB cohort is split between approximately 50% South Asian and 50% non-South Asian participants.\n\nBiB has completed a number of sub-sample studies including BiB1000, which focused on exploring ethnic variation and risk factors of childhood obesity. Data collection included questionnaires with parents when the children were between 6 and 36 months at 6 monthly intervals.The ALLIN and MeDALL studies focused on the relationships between childhood allergies and infections. Data collection for these studies were done via a questionnaire and, for the MeDALL study, children were asked to have a skin allergy test.\n\nSince 2016, BiB have undertaken a full cohort follow-up compromising of home visits for data collection through questionnaires, school visits where children carried out cognitive assessments, and a child measurement programme where children were weighed and measured, had their activity levels measured, and were asked to give a blood sample.\n\nFrom the findings of these studies, BiB have developed a range of additional research projects such as evaluating and developing new interventions to improve health; for example, focusing on reducing childhood obesity, increasing physical activity, improving oral health and improving mental wellbeing. BiB have gone beyond functioning as an observational birth cohort and are actively trying to build and strengthen local research capacity and translate evidence to practice.",

Moreover, advanced analytical approaches used in observational studies can help identify causality and potential for early-life interventions on factors that cannot be easily studied in experimental settings. These factors include socioeconomic circumstances, migration, urban environment as well as lifestyle-related determinants and will be given particular focus in our project. We will set up a European pregnancy and childhood cohort, the EU Child Cohort Network, which brings together extensive existing data from more than 250,000 European children and their parents. These cohorts enable studies in multiple generations because of their detailed phenotyping of both parents and children. The network will bring together existing successful multidisciplinary cohort studies, which all started before or during pregnancy or in childhood. Together, they span the full life course and contain detailed phenotypical information as well as biological samples. The EU Child Cohort Network will optimize exploitation of more than 40 available cohort resources in Europe and will enable innovative research on identification of novel markers of early-life stressors related to health trajectories throughout the full life cycle. Although LifeCycle partners and their cohorts have taken the initiative for this unique collaboration, the network is open to other partners with population-based cohorts started in early life, specifically those from Eastern and Southern Europe. To ensure that this will be a Europe-wide, open and sustainable network, which exceeds the LifeCycle Project duration, we will introduce a data sharing platform taking account of ethical, legal and societal implications, we will organize yearly meetings open to all European pregnancy and child cohort researchers and we will start a fellowship programme for exchange between these European cohorts.",

When T-cells encounter tumour antigens they are activated and promote lymphocyte proliferation and recruitment to the tumour site. This inflammatory response increases blood flow and vascular permeability, which can be measured with dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. Early after starting treatment, immune activation will also lead to T-cell tumour infiltration and increased tumour cellularity, which potentially can be quantified by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and radiomics features derived from computational image analysis. Preliminary data suggests that texture measures can capture the spatial heterogeneity of different sites of disease and predict treatment resistance and progression-free survival in the metastatic setting. Moreover, MRI measurements that integrate whole tumour volumetry, diffusion-weighted imaging (ADC) and radiomics (texture analysis) (Larkin T.J. et al.; 2014, Booth T.C. et al., 2017; Newman A.M. et al., 2015) may provide a therapy response assessment. Preliminary data suggests that texture measures can capture the spatial heterogeneity of metastases and predict treatment resistance and progression-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer. Aim Demonstrate and validate (1) PET with a 89Zrlabelled anti-CD8 minibody, to visualize serially the presence of CD8 expressing T-lymphocytes in cancer patients receiving CIT; (2) contribution of MRI measurements of intra- and inter-site tumour heterogeneity. Study design In patients with potential relevant indication for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition treatment (CIT) (e.g. melanoma or NSCLC) and at least one accessible lesion for biopsy, [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 PET imaging (1.5 mg anti human CD8 minibody [89Zr]Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, 37 MBq) will be injected and imaging will be performed before the start and 7 days before the 3rd checkpoint inhibitor administration. Whole body [89Zr]Zr-anti-CD8 distribution will be determined: tumour and normal organ radioactive tracer uptake will be quantified as standardized uptake values (SUV). Patients will undergo multi-parametric MR before and after the 1st cycle and before the 3rd cycle (drugs administered on 2-3 weekly cycles). The third and final MRI will be performed within ~9 weeks after the start of treatment, or on disease progression, whichever is sooner. All metastases determined to be suitable for MR imaging will be evaluated to assess differential tumour response and pseudo-progression. Patients will also undergo contrast-enhanced CT to determine tumour response using iRECIST. Tumour biopsies will be extensively analysed. Statistical considerations: Initial feasibility will be shown in 12 patients. Depending on the tumour type chosen the number of patients required may be increased in order to have sufficient patients with a tumour response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment.",

Epidemiological research with these cohorts over the past decades has greatly increased the understanding of distribution and mechanisms of psychotic disorders. Carrying out cross-country comparisons on a larger scale is extremely costly. An alternative strategy is to pool the existing large amount of data from high-quality early psychosis studies at an individual patient level. This approach has multiple advantages: it allows for examining psychosis determinants with greater precision, also including rare exposures and outcomes, focusing on (long-term) follow-up, and making optimal use of already existing data. To achieve this, the International Psychosis Epidemiology Consortium (IPEC) has catalogued and harmonized data from early psychosis cohorts and set up a virtual databank. With this databank, multiple (epidemiological) studies within the scope of the following research question will be conducted: \u201cWhat drives the course of functional, existential and clinical outcomes of (early) psychosis and how does the social and geographical context shape these patterns?\u201d.",

Moreover, advanced analytical approaches used in observational studies can help identify causality and potential for early-life interventions on factors that cannot be easily studied in experimental settings. These factors include socioeconomic circumstances, migration, urban environment as well as lifestyle-related determinants and will be given particular focus in our project. We will set up a European pregnancy and childhood cohort, the EU Child Cohort Network, which brings together extensive existing data from more than 250,000 European children and their parents. These cohorts enable studies in multiple generations because of their detailed phenotyping of both parents and children. The network will bring together existing successful multidisciplinary cohort studies, which all started before or during pregnancy or in childhood. Together, they span the full life course and contain detailed phenotypical information as well as biological samples. The EU Child Cohort Network will optimize exploitation of more than 40 available cohort resources in Europe and will enable innovative research on identification of novel markers of early-life stressors related to health trajectories throughout the full life cycle. Although LifeCycle partners and their cohorts have taken the initiative for this unique collaboration, the network is open to other partners with population-based cohorts started in early life, specifically those from Eastern and Southern Europe. To ensure that this will be a Europe-wide, open and sustainable network, which exceeds the LifeCycle Project duration, we will introduce a data sharing platform taking account of ethical, legal and societal implications, we will organize yearly meetings open to all European pregnancy and child cohort researchers and we will start a fellowship programme for exchange between these European cohorts.",
